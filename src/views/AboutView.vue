    <h3 class="content">
      <strong>Somewhat of a philomath</strong>, I’m very analytical, and find
      pleasure in reasoning about the most varying subjects - from understanding
      the formation of the universe to the origin of species.<br /><br />
      From a young age I realized that I <strong>loved solving puzzles</strong>,
      and in programming I found an environment that is filled with them. I got
      addicted to the process of finding solutions and seeing my work help
      people on their most mundane tasks.<br /><br />
      I enjoy taking challenges, and leveraging from other people’s cultures and
      experiences.
