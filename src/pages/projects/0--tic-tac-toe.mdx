<Game />

Far from the ideal week, but I ended up finishing the game.
Some key technical takeaways were:

##### 1 - Using a singleton [Audio Manager](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/audio/audio_manager/)
##### 2 - [CanvasLayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/classes/class_canvaslayer.html) can help in covering the entire screen
##### 3 - Detecting collision on objects when mouse clicks
Kind of a hacky implementation, but I made so that each cell has its own CollisionShape, so that it's easier
to determine when a click on a valid cell happens.
```gdscript
func _input(event):
	if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.pressed and event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT:
		var mousePos = get_global_mouse_position()
		var space = get_world_2d().direct_space_state
		var collision_objects = space.intersect_point(mousePos, 1)
    if collision_objects:
			var cell = collision_objects[0].collider.name
			print("detected press on cell: " + cell)
```
