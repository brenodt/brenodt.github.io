I did not have the time I wanted to dedicate myself into this side-project, but thankfully I got to an MVP.

In terms of organization, one thing I did that was super helpful was to completely organize assets and what not
*before* starting to code. By the end of Sunday, I had a scene with the two pads, a center separator, the
scores and a basic menu (much cleaner than the one from tic-tac-toe).
This streamlined a lot of the coding/development later on, which happened in a total of 5 hours, a bit on Monday,
the remainder on Saturday.

Some key technical takeaways were:

##### 1 - Using the [bounce](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/tutorials/physics/using_kinematic_body_2d.html) method to have the ball behave as expected - clean and intuitive
##### 2 - First usage of custom Signals
##### 3 - `queue_free()` to destroy `self`
```gdscript
# Ball physics update
func _physics_process(delta):
	var collision = move_and_collide(velocity * delta)
	if collision:
		if collision.collider.name == LFT_WALL.name:
			emit_signal("player2_scores")
			queue_free()
		if collision.collider.name == RGT_WALL.name:
			emit_signal("player1_scores")
			queue_free()

		velocity = velocity.bounce(collision.normal)
		velocity.x *= HIT_BUMP_FACTOR
		velocity.y *= HIT_BUMP_FACTOR
```
##### 4 - Name of the node that owns the script
```gdscript
# I use the same piece of code to control both pads. The only difference is the keys that move up/down.
# To differentiate, I just check what is the name of the node that owns the given script
var nodeName = $".".name
var UP_KEY = KEY_W if nodeName == "Player1" else KEY_I
var DN_KEY = KEY_S if nodeName == "Player1" else KEY_K
```
